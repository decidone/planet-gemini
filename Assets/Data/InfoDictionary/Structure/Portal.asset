  explanation: The Portal is a building that enables fast travel between portals
    on the same planet. Portals placed by the player are blue, while the main interplanetary
    portal is red. When a player approaches a portal, an interaction key (F) appears.
    Pressing the key opens a map showing available portals, and clicking on a portal
    allows instant travel to that location. Only the red main portal allows travel
    to another planet.
